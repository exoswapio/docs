## What is Exoswap?

**Exoswap** is a Decentralized Application (**DApp**) that interacts with multiple EVM-based chains like Stratos, Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and others to provide users with functionalities such as:
 - Exoswap bridge (ERC20 token transfer between EVM chains);


**Exoswap bridge** is a scaling solution for connection between EVM chains with own DEX. Compared to an existing solution for the bridge side, which suffers from slow speed and significantly higher gas costs for its executions, we have taken a different approach. Our method relies on SAO and witnesses to process and verify bridge transactions, ensuring protection against fraud, all while achieving fast confirmation times. ([architecture](../bridge/architecture))


## How to be connected with Stratos chain?
Since Stratos is an EVM compatible chain, integrating it with non-custodial wallets (e.g., MetaMask) is a straightforward process. You can easily add Stratos as a custom network by accessing the connection details [here](network-details/network).

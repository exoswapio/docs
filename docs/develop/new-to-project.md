## What is Exoswap?

**Exoswap** is a Decentralized application (**DApp**) which interacts with multiple EVM based chains like Stratos, Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and rest to provide for a user functionality like:
 - Exoswap bridge (ERC20 token transfer between EVM chains);

**Exoswap bridge** is a scaling solution for connection between EVM chains with own DEX. Regarding to an existing solution for the bridge side, where the speed is slow and extremly higher gas costs for it executions, we are did another approach, based on SAO and witnesses for process and verify for fraud the bridge transactions on in according to safe confirmation time. ([architecture](../bridge/architecture))
